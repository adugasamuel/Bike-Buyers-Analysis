# Bike Buyers Analysis Trend Using Power BI

##  Introduction  
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of customer data obtained from a US-based bike-selling store with branches across other global regions. Using **Power BI**, an interactive dashboard was developed to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights among various customer attributes such as income, education, marital status, commute distance, and region. The goal is to enable data-driven decisions that improve targeted marketing and increase sales.

## Problem Statement  
Despite a sizable customer base, there is a lack of clarity on what characteristics differentiate bike buyers from non-buyers. The organization needs to understand the key drivers behind bike purchases in order to tailor marketing strategies, optimize outreach efforts, and improve customer targeting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim of the Project  
To identify the major demographic and socioeconomic factors that influence bike purchases using data visualization and analytics, and to develop a Power BI dashboard that presents these insights in a clear, interactive format for informed business decision-making.

## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated  
- Data Cleaning and Preparation  
- Data Modeling using Power BI  
- DAX Calculations for KPIs  
- Data Transformation in Power Query  
- Slicer and Filter Implementation  
- Visual Storytelling and Design  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Business Insight Generation  

## Data Modeling  
The dataset was loaded into Power BI and underwent necessary transformation in Power Query. Relationships were modeled based on unique identifiers to ensure the data was structured and optimized for analysis. Measures were created using DAX to compute KPIs such as total buyers, purchase rate, and average income of buyers and non-buyers.

## Visualization  
The dashboard consists of **two main pages**:

### Page 1 - Demographics Overview:  
- Clustered column charts and bar charts for Age, Gender, Marital Status, Region, Education, and Number of Children  
- KPI cards for Total Number of Buyers and Purchase Rate  
- Slicers for Car Owner, Home Owner, and Commute Distance  

### Page 2 - Income & Commute Patterns:  
- Bar charts analyzing buyers by Income Range and Average Income  
- Commute distance distribution among buyers  
- KPI cards for Average Income of Buyers vs Non-Buyers  

## Data Analysis & Insights

### ðŸ”‘ KPIs  
- **Total Buyers:** 481  
- **Total Non-Buyers:** 519  
- **Purchase Rate:** 48.10%  
- **Average Income (Buyers):** $58K  
- **Average Income (Non-Buyers):** $54K  

### ðŸ’¡ Key Insights  
- Buyers are mostly aged **31â€“54**, showing a strong mid-age demographic.  
- **Males and married individuals** form the bulk of bike buyers.  
- Individuals with **Bachelorâ€™s degrees** are more likely to purchase.  
- **1 or 2 children** in the household correlates with higher purchase rates.  
- Most buyers earn **$60Kâ€“$90K or $30Kâ€“$60K**.  
- Buyers often commute **0â€“1 mile or 5â€“10 miles**, suggesting short- to mid-range travel use.  
- **North America** has the highest buyer and non-buyer counts, suggesting high saturation and opportunity for focused strategies.

## ðŸ§­ Recommendations  
- Focus marketing on **males aged 35â€“44** with mid-range incomes ($60Kâ€“$90K).  
- Develop targeted ads for **married individuals with young families**.

- Consider **family-focused bike models** for households with 1â€“2 children.
  
The recommendation was made to help the company identify and target potential bike buyers more
effectively by understanding key customer segments based on age, income, commute distance, and lifestyle. 
This insight will guide more personalized marketing, improve sales conversion, 
and support data-driven decision-making for future product and campaign strategies.
