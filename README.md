🚴‍ Bike Buyers Analysis — Power BI Dashboard
Executive Summary
This project delivers a professional two-page Power BI dashboard analyzing bike buyer demographics and purchasing behavior. Using a dataset of 1,000 customers, the dashboard reveals who buys bikes and why, comparing buyers vs non-buyers across income, age, education, region, commute distance, and family size.
Key findings show that middle-aged professionals with higher incomes and shorter commutes are the most likely to purchase bikes, while purchase likelihood decreases with more children. These insights directly inform marketing strategy, product targeting, and regional expansion opportunities.
👉 This repository includes:
•	The Power BI .pbix file (full dashboard).
•	A PowerPoint summary deck prepared for executive review.
•	Screenshots of the dashboards (Overview & Demography).

Introduction
The dataset was obtained from the Bike Buyers Dataset on Kaggle. It is a simulated dataset that mirrors real-world sales and customer demographic information, commonly used for analytical and visualization practice.
This project forms part of my professional Data Analyst portfolio and demonstrates how to turn raw customer data into meaningful insights using Power BI, DAX, and analytical storytelling.

Project Description
This project centers on building a two-page interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a clear picture of customer behavior in bike purchases. It identifies key buyer segments and helps businesses understand how income, demographics, commute, and lifestyle influence purchase decisions.
The dashboard is designed to be management-ready: visually intuitive, interactive, and structured to answer strategic business questions in seconds.

Project Context
Organizations often struggle to understand which customers are most likely to purchase bikes. Without data-driven insights, marketing strategies remain broad, inefficient, and costly.
By applying business intelligence techniques to customer data, this project provides actionable insights that can:
•	Reduce wasted marketing spend.
•	Improve buyer targeting.
•	Increase overall bike sales.

Problem Statement
The company lacks clear, data-backed insights into who its bike customers are. Without this knowledge, resources are misallocated, and sales growth opportunities are missed.
Specifically:
•	Which age groups, income brackets, and occupations are most likely to buy bikes?
•	How do factors like region, commute distance, and family size affect purchases?
•	What customer profiles should the company prioritize for marketing and sales campaigns?
This project addresses these questions by analyzing the dataset and creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard.

Aim of the Project
The project aims to:
•	Identify demographic and economic factors influencing bike purchases.
•	Compare buyers vs non-buyers on income, family size, and commute distance.
•	Create an interactive and professional Power BI dashboard with executive-ready visuals.
•	Provide strategic recommendations to increase sales and improve customer targeting.
•	Showcase technical, analytical, and storytelling skills for my professional portfolio.

My Approach
🔹 Data Cleaning Checklist
•	Loaded the Bike_Buyer dataset with the following fields:
ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, Purchase Bike.
•	Removed blank spaces and standardized categorical values (e.g., M → Male, F → Female).
•	Checked and corrected data types.
•	Created age and income bins for better segmentation.
•	Removed duplicates and missing values.
Context:
•	Rows before cleaning: 1,027
•	Rows after cleaning: 1,000

🔹 Modelling & Engineering
Since this was a flat table dataset, advanced modeling was not required. Steps included:
1.	Data load and transformation.
2.	Normalization and categorical cleaning.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
4.	Creation of DAX measures for KPIs.
5.	Dashboard visualizations with custom theme.
6.	Navigation buttons for a professional user experience.

Analysis / Work Done
🔹 Key DAX Measures
Total Buyers =
CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('BikeData'), 'BikeData'[Purchased Bike] = "Yes")

Total Non-Buyers =
CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('BikeData'), 'BikeData'[Purchased Bike] = "No")

Purchase Rate (%) =
DIVIDE([Total Buyers], [Total Buyers] + [Total Non-Buyers], 0) * 100

Avg Income Buyers =
CALCULATE(AVERAGE('BikeData'[Income]), 'BikeData'[Purchased Bike] = "Yes")

Avg Income Non-Buyers =
CALCULATE(AVERAGE('BikeData'[Income]), 'BikeData'[Purchased Bike] = "No")
These measures were critical for building KPI cards and comparative visuals.

Recommendations
1.	Target middle-aged professionals — the largest buyer group.
2.	Expand marketing in the Pacific region, which has higher buyer share.
3.	Highlight short-distance commuting benefits (0–1 mile commuters show higher adoption).
4.	Segment by income:
o	Affordable models for 10–50k earners.
o	Premium options for 60–100k+ customers.
5.	Offer family packages or promotions to offset declining purchases in larger families.
